# Animated Clock 

## Introduction
A vanilla javascript clock

In this project, I've created an animated clock that showcases my skills in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience.

## Features

- Real-time Timekeeping: The clock accurately displays the current time, updating every second.
- Smooth Animation: The clock hands move gracefully, providing a pleasing visual experience.
- Responsive Design: The clock is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The foundation of the project, providing the structure and content of the clock.
- **CSS:** Used to style the clock, including its colors, shapes, and layout.
- **JavaScript:** The dynamic component of the clock, responsible for real-time updates and smooth animation.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the process of creating this project, I've gained valuable insights and skills:

- **CSS Flexibility:** I've learned how to use CSS flexbox to create a responsive and centered layout, ensuring the clock looks great on a variety of devices.

- **CSS Transitions:** Implementing smooth animations using CSS transitions has deepened my understanding of adding interactivity to web elements.

- **JavaScript Timing:** By working with the `setInterval` function, I've grasped the concept of timing events in JavaScript, which is crucial for real-time applications.

- **Responsive Design:** Creating a clock that works seamlessly on different devices taught me how to utilize media queries effectively to tailor the user experience.

## Future Endeavors

This project marks just the beginning of my journey into web development. Building upon the foundation of this Animated Clock, I'm excited to embark on more advanced projects, deepen my expertise in front-end and back-end technologies, and explore new realms of programming.
